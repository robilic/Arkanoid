Gold bricks cannot be destroyed at all. They are indestructible, and therefore not counted against you towards your attempt to clear an area of bricks. Silver bricks take more than one hit to destroy. In the beginning, they only require two to destroy, but the number of hits it takes to remove them increases by one every eight stages.
